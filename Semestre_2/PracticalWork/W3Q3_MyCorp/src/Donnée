Furthermore, the following relationships are imposed:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 -A Company has one top level Function (in this case, the Chief Executive Officer)
 -A Function has a relationship of responsibility to other Functions (for example, function Sales is responsible of Magazines and Books);
 conversely, a Function is dependent to another Function (Magazines depends to Sales)
 -Functions are grouped into Positions (for example the Division Directors position has the Sales, Procurement and Finance functions)
 -Write a method displayDependency(Function f) that outputs the dependency of a function:
    The employee Vincent Jaton depends from John Smith
 Write a method displayResponsibilities(Function f) that outputs the responsabilities of a function:
    The employe John Smith is responsible for
        Vincent Jaton
        Fabian Vernier
        Marcel Jaquet
 -For all classes, write a toString() method.
